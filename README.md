# Nusfjord Shuffler

A random setup generator for https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234277/nusfjord

## Motivation

I'm writing this mostly to teach myself Rust. This would make more sense as a Javascript in browser app, 
but Rust is what I am teaching myself. A port to JS will not only be welcome, but I will use it.

I know that sometimes I am using an overkill way of doing things (using tui to get terminal size) but I am
also trying to teach myself these libraries.

## Features

1. Mixing decks
1. Dealing in game cards as spoiler text (assumes black background)

## Not supported

1. Campaign mode
